<h5>What the heck is a BarCamp and why do we want one in the Fox Valley?</h5>

<p>A BarCamp has been described as an "unconference". A conference where the
topics, sessions, speakers are all determined by the people who show up. Sort of
like the concept of a Wiki applied to conferences. Another way to think of it is
a do-it-yourself conference.
</p>

<p>You want to discuss the merits of Social Media? Scribble your topic on a piece of
paper, tape it to the "Session Wall" and see who shows up! You'd love to see a
demonstration of Google's Android platform? Maybe put up "Sessions Wanted"
sheet and list "Android demo" and viola, instant session!
</p>

<p>As of this writing, I've <a href="http://barcampmilwaukee.org">attended only one BarCamp</a>. That was enough for me to
realize that I want to attend as many as possible. So much so, that I've
 <a href="http://barcampfoxvalley.org">registered a domain</a> and 
 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/barcampfoxvalley-discuss">setup a mailing list</a>
to get the conversation moving in the Fox Valley.

<p>In addition to the participants ("campers" if you will) there are many other
factors that contribute to a successful BarCamp. Venue, projectors, WiFi,
tables, chairs, food/beverage, restrooms, etc, etc. If any interested have
leads on these items, or potential sponsors/donors email the mailing list.
