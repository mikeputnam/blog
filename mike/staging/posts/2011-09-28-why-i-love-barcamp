<h5>Why I love BarCamp</h5>

<p>
Think back to your earliest encounter with the World Wide Web. Do you recall
that sense of wonderment, intrigue, and mystery about what this Internet thing
had in store? Every first-click on a hyperlink could be taking you to something
fantastic (or terrible); you never really knew. This is still true of the web.
Hunting around in the infinite ever-changingness for my own
diamonds-in-the-rough continues to be a part of my life so many years later.

What does this have to do with "<a title="BarCamp"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a>"?
</p>

<p>
For me, BarCamp is just like the wonderful, nebulous WWW. I go with a sense
of excitement to see what I can learn, contribute, who I will meet, what new
ideas I will come away with or perhaps give someone else. The very nature of an
"unconference" is a meetup of people open to the unknown, hoping to find or
create some bit of knowledge or share an idea about something that interests
them. Just as with the web, you may encounter sessions or discussions about
topics that do not interest you and just as with the web, you can click the back
button and continue your journey along some other path. If you don't like a
session, get up and move your two feet to the next one that you do like. It's
expected!
</p>

<p>
For this reason, I heartily encourage you to seek out the next BarCamp you
can attend and do so.

P.P.S. While already past, <a title="BarCampMadison"

adding to your calendar for 2012.
