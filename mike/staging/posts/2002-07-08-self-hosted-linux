<h2>Self Hosted Linux</h2>

<p>
The computer that <b>theputnams.net</b> is running on is a frankensteined, 9 year old CTX, with a 200MHz CPU and 64MB of ram.
I believe Amy purchased it for around $1200-$1300 as a schoolwork-pc while attending UW-Milwaukee. With the exception of the HD crash in
Feb 2002, it has been on non-stop for last 3 years.

How's that for return on investment!
