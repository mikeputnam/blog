<u>SYNOPSIS</u>
<b><p>
Today at the <a href="http://appletonmakerspace.org">Appleton
Makerspace</a>, I took my first steps learning to weld.
</p></b>

<u>DESCRIPTION</u>
<b><p>
I prepared by watching several Youtube videos on safety and technique. I
also got an impromptu demonstration from Jake Kasper at the Appleton
Makerspace.
</p></b>

<b><p>
In the above photo, the bottom-right weld was the very first attempt. Lots
of splatter and completely missed the seam as I discover what it is like to work
behind the welding mask and wield multiple thousands of degrees of heat. The
top-left weld I managed to slow down and allow the bead and heat to catch up.
Too slow however as the puddle turned into more of a loaf. The very top weld in
the photo was the 3rd attempt and I think the best one. Still need lots of
practice, but it will be fun practice.

I scavenged an old steel bed frame I had been saving and now I have lots of
practice material. (Much cheaper than $5 for a 3ft section at the store.)

<b><p>
Even saved the cut-off wheels for some future project.
</p></b>

<b><p>
Essential tools and skills I managed to sample:
</p></b>

<b><p>
<ol> <li>Welder (thanks Tyler Doupe for the welder and Mark Finn for all the
setup!)</li> <li>Wire wheel(thanks Jacob Kasper!) to remove paint and improve
conductivity.</li> <li>Safety equip.(thanks to lots of people!) like gloves,
long sleeves and pants, heavy shoes under the pant leg, ear protection (esp when
cutting/grinding), safety glasses, welding helmet, and face sheild.</li>
<li>Angle grinder (thanks Shane Grey!) to more quickly remove paint, grind edges
and cut off rivets.</li> <li>Cutoff wheel (thanks Simeon Dorsey!) to cut angle
steel down to size.</li> <li>Makeshift welding table (thanks Jason Kuehl!) from
upside down DIY server rack.</li> </ol>
