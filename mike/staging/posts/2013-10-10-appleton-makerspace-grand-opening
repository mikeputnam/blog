<u>DESCRIPTION</u>
<b><p>
A little over 3 years ago, a rag-tag group of techie maker types started 
getting together at restaurants and in each others kitchens and living rooms 
to <a href="/mike/2010-11-07-arduino-happy-birthday-emitter.htm">mess around 
with Arduino</a>, share progress on authoring 
<a href="/mike/2011-02-01-gladiator-girl.htm">a book</a>, or work on a 
<a href="/mike/2011-01-16-a-timelapse-doodle.htm">creative</a> 
<a href="/mike/2011-05-08-dhmn-candybot-won.htm">project</a>.
</p></b>

<b><p>
Today the Distributed Hacker/Maker Network(Appleton Makerspace) has 119 people on it's mailing list, 
many <a href="https://trello.com/board/dhmn-project-board/4f70faa86d6797f24b375c14">projects</a> 
complete, and a leased space which we've dubbed the "<a href="https://appletonmakerspace.org/">Appleton Makerspace</a>."

Come celebrate with us and help spread the word about our group, our building, 
and our long term goal of being the best community resource in the area for 
hackers and makers.
