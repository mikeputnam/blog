<h2>Arduino &#47; 20×2 Epson LCD</h2>

<p>Behold! The worlds worst quality YouTube video!
</p>

<p>Anyway, due to my lack of skill/video equipment, I’m going to call this good enough after two attempts to capture it legibly.
</p>

<p>In a nutshell, it’s an Arduino and a 20 character x 2 row backlit LCD with a contrast knob. I’ve got several of these as spare parts so we’ll probably see them resurface in other projects.
