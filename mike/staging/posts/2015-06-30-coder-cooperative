<p>I've resurrected a community group at the Appleton Makerspace under a new name "Coder Cooperative"!</p>

<p>The interesting bits are already covered on <a href="http://appletonmakerspace.org/codercooperative/">the canonical web page for "Coder Cooperative"</a>.</p>

<p>This post is less of an introductory and more of a thank-you to the participants. Attendance at the meetings has been steady and growing. People are coming out from a wide cross-section of groups and interests.</p>

<p>I couldn't be happier with the excitement for the group.</p>

<p>So, THANK-YOU Coder Cooperative participants and let's keep the conversation going every Monday night 7pm-9pm in the computer lab at the Appleton Makerspace!</p>
