<u>NAME</u>
<b>How can you organize your docker containers?</b>

<u>DESCRIPTION</u>
<b><p>
The moment you cross over the mental threshold from using <a
href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> for local development/experimentation
to using docker as a host for important things, you'll begin to have questions.
One of the early questions I had was, "How can I organize all these containers
when all <span class="arg">$ docker ps -a</span> gives me is "NAMES"?  The answer
to that question is <a
href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/labels-custom-metadata/">Labels!</a>
</p></b>

<b><p>
You can assign labels to images within <span class="arg">Dockerfiles</span> or
to containers with the <span class="arg">$ docker run</span> and <span class="arg">$
docker daemon</span> commands.
</p></b>

<b><p>
You can query for images with <span class="arg">$ docker images --filter
"label=color=blue"</span>, containers with <span class="arg">$ docker ps --filter
"label=color=blue"</span> or via <span class="arg">$ docker inspect</span>
</p></b>

<b><p>
Docker treats the labels as simple strings, but if you want to get fancy you
can store string-escaped JSON data if you want to write your own label
parser.
