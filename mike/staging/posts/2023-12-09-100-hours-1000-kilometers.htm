<u>DESCRIPTION</u>
<b><p>
Around the most scary time of COVID-19 (in 2020) when we were all uncertain if we were dealing with black plague level of lethality and transmissibility, I started running.
</p></b>

<b><p>
This was partly due to the cabin fever of working from home for a decade,  partly due to self-quarantine about COVID, and partly due to being my heaviest over-weightness ever.
</p></b>

<b><p>
It began as slow jogs until I was gasping for breath. In other words, around the block once or twice.
</p></b>

<b><p>
Staying fixated on the distance and time allowed me to try to at least do as good as the last run, if not a smidge better.
</p></b>

<b><p>
Once I could do 5k (3.12 miles) without walking, I started seeking races in addition.
</p></b>

<b><p>
5k's and later 10k's combined with tracking progress ended up being a great motivator. Lost around 40lbs and got the BMI within "normal".
</p></b>

<b><p>
Now I'm working on a next goal of a half-marathon 21 kilometers / 13.1 miles. Maybe Spring of 2024 I'll be ready.
