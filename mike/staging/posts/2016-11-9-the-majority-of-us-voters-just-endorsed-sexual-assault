<h2>The majority of US voters</h2>

<img src="images/2016-11-09-wsj.png"/>

<p>As evidenced by the outcome of the election, the majority of US voters endorse this conduct:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sexual assault is okay.</li>
<li>Treating people differently because they do not look like you or do not share your religion, is okay.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are one of this majority, this conduct is very NOT OKAY.</p>

<p>If you voted for Donald Trump, you endorse this conduct.</p>

<p>If you voted for Donald Trump but argue that you do not endorse this conduct, you placed greater importance on something else and decided this conduct was acceptable; something you could look past. This is endorsement.</p>

<p>Since you voted for Donald Trump, and therefore endorse sexual assault and race/religion hatred, fuck you.</p>

<p>Fuck you very much.</p>
