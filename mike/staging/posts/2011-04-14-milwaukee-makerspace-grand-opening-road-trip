<u>NAME</u>
<b>Milwaukee Makerspace Grand Opening</b>

<u>DESCRIPTION</u>
<b><p>
We traveled with a delegation of people from the <a
href="https://appletonmakerspace.org/">Distributed Hacker/Maker Network(Appleton Makerspace)</a>, attended <a
href="http://www.milwaukeemakerspace.org/content/grand-opening-party">the grand
opening of the Milwaukee Makerspace on 4/9/2011</a>. Hundreds of people were in
attendance checking out the space and the mini Maker Fair.
</p>

<b><p>
We just missed the the Powerwheels race, but heard it was a hoot — grown
adults racing modified children’s toys is generally a good time in my opinion.
Upon entering the building, the height of the working space immediately conveys
how easily a trebuchet or catapult could be built in the large bay. Lots and
lots of headroom. At the registration table we were greeted cheerfully and
handed the release form to fill out. I grabbed a Milwaukee Makerspace
bumpersticker and bought a t-shirt.
</p></b>

<b><p>
First table was the biodiesel demonstration. Large vats, barrels, and beakers
were visible as a gentleman explained the basic process of creating
biodiesel.
</p></b>

<b><p>
Near by, people were attempting to stump the makers by showing odd
tools/parts/miscellany and having the makers guess what it was. The audience
member won a t-shirt if they were successful in flummoxing the makers.
</p></b>

<b><p>
Next up was a table with an <a
href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Build_your_own_Electric_Car/">enthusiastic
man</a> answering questions about making/owning/using a homebuilt electric
car.
</p></b>

<b><p>
A table containing Sumobots, three-toed Converse, and a MakerBot stood
nearby.
</p></b>

<b><p>
Set back a bit was the circuit-bending music/instrument table. I spent a lot
of time there messing with knobs and switches as Matt worked the mixer volumes
to normalize the overall experience for (in)voluntary listeners :)
</p></b>

<b><p>
In front of that was <a href="http://rasterweb.net/raster/">Pete</a> and the
<a
href="http://rasterweb.net/raster/2011/01/12/friday-night-drawbot/">DrawBot</a>,
<a href="http://rasterweb.net/raster/tag/eggbot/">EggBot</a>, <a
href="http://rasterweb.net/raster/2010/11/13/twitter-monkey-video/">Twitter
Monkey</a>, and paper towel tube nun-chucks.
</p></b>

<b><p>
To the right sat an array of interesting clocks and devices.
</p></b>

<b><p>
Back in the machine room there were of course machines. Lathes, mills, drill
presses, homemade cnc!, and all manners of large fabrication devices. For fun
there was a pinball machine and a mystical portal from which you could peer into
the simultaneously occurring <a

II</a> in Minnesota.
</p></b>

<b><p>
The library housed a build-a-blinker class led by Royce where participants
built an LED blinker from five components and some mad soldering skills.
</p></b>

<b><p>
Everyone I encountered, Milwaukee Makerspace member or not, was very friendly
and enthusiastic about being creative. It’s days/events/places/people like this
that make me happy to live in and be a part of Wisconsin.
