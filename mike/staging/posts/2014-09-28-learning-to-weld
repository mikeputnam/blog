<h2>My Initial Foray into Welding</h2>

<p>Today at the <a href="http://appletonmakerspace.org">Appleton Makerspace</a>, I took my first steps learning to weld.</p>

<p>I prepared by watching several Youtube videos on safety and technique. I also got an impromptu demonstration from Jake Kasper at the Appleton Makerspace.</p>

<p>In the above photo, the bottom-right weld was the very first attempt. Lots of splatter and completely missed the seam as I discover what it is like to work behind the welding mask and wield multiple thousands of degrees of heat. The top-left weld I managed to slow down and allow the bead and heat to catch up. Too slow however as the puddle turned into more of a loaf. The very top weld in the photo was the 3rd attempt and I think the best one. Still need lots of practice, but it will be fun practice.</p>

<p>I scavenged an old steel bed frame I had been saving and now I have lots of practice material. (Much cheaper than $5 for a 3ft section at the store.)</p>

<p>Even saved the cut-off wheels for some future project.</p>

<p>Essential tools and skills I managed to sample:</p>

<ul>
<li>Welder (thanks Tyler Doupe for the welder and Mark Finn for all the setup!)</li>
<li>Wire wheel(thanks Jacob Kasper!) to remove paint and improve conductivity.</li>
<li>Safety equip.(thanks to lots of people!) like gloves, long sleeves and pants, heavy shoes under the pant leg, ear protection (esp when cutting/grinding), safety glasses, welding helmet, and face sheild.</li>
<li>Angle grinder (thanks Shane Grey!) to more quickly remove paint, grind edges and cut off rivets.</li>
<li>Cutoff wheel (thanks Simeon Dorsey!) to cut angle steel down to size.</li>
<li>Makeshift welding table (thanks Jason Kuehl!) from upside down DIY server rack.</li>
</ul>

<p>Much in the way I can point to my mom and dad's interest in computing affecting my own fascination with computing, I can also point to both of my grandfathers for my (latent) interest in metal work and fabrication. I think the next thing I'll learn about (and point to) is sewing -- much of my family is "fiber able". I'd like to be able to put together a t-shirt that I can then screen print.</p>
