<u>NAME</u>
<b>What the heck is a BarCamp and why do we want one in the Fox Valley?</b>

<u>DESCRIPTION</u>
<b>
<p>A BarCamp has been described as an "unconference". A conference where the
topics, sessions, speakers are all determined by the people who show up. Sort of
like the concept of a Wiki applied to conferences. Another way to think of it is
a do-it-yourself conference.
</p>
</b>

<b>
<p>You want to discuss the merits of Social Media? Scribble your topic on a piece of
paper, tape it to the "Session Wall" and see who shows up! You'd love to see a
demonstration of Google's Android platform? Maybe put up "Sessions Wanted"
sheet and list "Android demo" and viola, instant session!
</p>

<b>
<p>As of this writing, I've attended only one BarCamp(BarCamp Milwaukee). That was enough for me to
realize that I want to attend as many as possible. So much so, that I've 
<s>registered a domain and setup a mailing list</s> to get the conversation moving in the Fox Valley.
</p>
</b>

<b>
<p>In addition to the participants ("campers" if you will) there are many other
factors that contribute to a successful BarCamp. Venue, projectors, WiFi,
tables, chairs, food/beverage, restrooms, etc, etc. If any interested have
leads on these items, or potential sponsors/donors email the mailing list.

<u>BUGS</u>
<b>
I've since allowed the domain and mailing list to lapse. 
I'd still like to attend/organize a Fox Valley BarCamp, alas I've taken no IRL action toward it.
