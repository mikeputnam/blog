<h2>What to make...</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">Sparkfun</a> had <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/news/1439">an Arduino Day sale</a> where many of their Arduino were marked half off or more.</p>

<p>I ordered a pair of Arduino Pro Mini 3.3v, an FTDI breakout board, headers, and a couple of coin cell battery holders.</p>

<p>Still not sure what to make.</p>

<p>Current ideas:<p>

<ul>
<li>Resurrect You've got snail mail! project.</li>
<li>Something with <a href="http://www.bajdi.com/rf24-library-revisited/">these inexpensive RF radios</a></li>
<li>And/or maybe these <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=OV7670+300KP#q=OV7670+300KP&tbm=shop">cheap camera modules</a></li>
<li>Etc...</li>
</ul>
