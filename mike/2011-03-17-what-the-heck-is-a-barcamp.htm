                <h5>What the heck is a BarCamp and why do we want one in the Fox
                Valley?</h5>
                <p>A BarCamp has been described as an “unconference”. A conference where the<br>
topics, sessions, speakers are all determined by the people who show up. Sort of<br>
like the concept of a Wiki applied to conferences. Another way to think of it is<br>
a do-it-yourself conference.</p>
<p>You want to discuss the merits of Social Media? Scribble your topic on a piece of<br>
paper, tape it to the “Session Wall” and see who shows up! You’d love to see a<br>
demonstration of Google’s Android platform? Maybe put up “Sessions Wanted”<br>
sheet and list “Android demo” and viola, instant session!</p>
<p>As of this writing, I’ve <a href="http://barcampmilwaukee.org">attended only one BarCamp</a>. That was enough for me to<br>
realize that I want to attend as many as possible. So much so, that I’ve<br>
 <a href="http://barcampfoxvalley.org">registered a domain</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/barcampfoxvalley-discuss">setup a mailing list</a><br>
to get the conversation moving in the Fox Valley.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In addition to the participants (“campers” if you will) there are many other<br>
factors that contribute to a successful BarCamp. Venue, projectors, WiFi,<br>
tables, chairs, food/beverage, restrooms, etc, etc. If any interested have<br>
leads on these items, or potential sponsors/donors email the mailing list.</p>
