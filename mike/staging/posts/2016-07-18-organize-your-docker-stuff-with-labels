<p>The moment you cross over the mental threshold from using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> for local development/experimentation to using docker as a host for important things, you'll begin to have questions. One of the early questions I had was, "How can I organize all these containers when all <span id="code">$ docker ps -a</span> gives me is "NAMES"?  The answer to that question is <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/labels-custom-metadata/">Labels!</a></p>

<p>You can assign labels to images within <span id="code">Dockerfiles</span> or to containers with the <span id="code">$ docker run</span> and <span id="code">$ docker daemon</span> commands.</p>

<p>You can query for images with <span id="code">$ docker images --filter "label=color=blue"</span>, containers with <span id="code">$ docker ps --filter "label=color=blue"</span> or via <span id="code">$ docker inspect</span></p>

<p>Docker treats the labels as simple strings, but if you want to get fancy you can store string-escaped JSON data if you want to write your own label parser.</p>
