<h2>Grand Opening! of the Appleton Makerspace powered by DHMN</h2>

<p>A little over 3 years ago, a rag-tag group of techie maker types started getting together at restaurants and in each others kitchens and living rooms to <a href="/mike/2010-11-20-arduino-youve-got-snail-mail-prototype-continues.htm">mess around with Arduino</a>, share progress on authoring <a href="/mike/2011-02-01-gladiator-girl.htm">a book</a>, or work on a <a href="/mike/2011-01-16-a-timelapse-doodle.htm">fun</a> <a href="/mike/2011-01-16-a-timelapse-doodle.htm">creative</a> <a href="/mike/2011-05-08-dhmn-candybot-won.htm">project</a>.</p>

<p>Today the Distributed Hacker/Maker Network has 119 people on it's <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/dhmn-discussion">mailing list</a>, many <a href="https://trello.com/board/dhmn-project-board/4f70faa86d6797f24b375c14">projects</a> complete, and a leased space which we've dubbed the "<a href="http://dhmn.net/appleton-makerspace/">Appleton Makerspace powered by DHMN</a>."</p>

<p>Come celebrate with us and help spread the word about our group, our building, and our long term goal of being the best community resource in the area for hackers and makers.</p>

<p>Visit us! We'll have projects on display, makers to meet, and a glimpse of our future new home....</p>
