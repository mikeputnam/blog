<h2>A Copper Thing</h2>

<p>I made a copper thing. It ended up resembling a withered tree. Used stranded wire, CAT5 wire, heavy gauge solid core wire, and silver solder.</p>

<p>I also fashioned my first makeshift light box to unclutter the background and diffuse the light of my photos.</p>

<p>Made light box from a small styrofoam cooler. Cut sides out with a coping saw blade. Duct taped white paper over the sides. Set the light box in a sunny window for the shot.</p>
