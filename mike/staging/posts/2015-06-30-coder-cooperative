</p></b>

<u>SYNOPSIS</u>
<b><p>
I've resurrected a community group at the Appleton Makerspace under a new
name "Coder Cooperative"!
</p></b>

<b><p>
<s>The interesting bits are already covered on the canonical web page
for "Coder Cooperative"</s>.
</p></b>

<u>DESCRIPTION</u>
<b><p>
This post is less of an introductory and more of a thank-you to the
participants. Attendance at the meetings has been steady and growing. People are
coming out from a wide cross-section of groups and interests.
</p></b>

<b><p>
I couldn't be happier with the excitement for the group.
</p></b>

<b><p>
So, THANK-YOU Coder Cooperative participants and let's keep the conversation
going every Monday night 7pm-9pm in the computer lab at the Appleton
Makerspace!
</p></b>

<u>BUGS</u>
<b>Another brief period that has since ended. Coder Cooperative no longer meets.  :(</b>
