<u>NAME</u>
<b>
Arduino &#44; MOSFET &#44; iRobot wheels
</b>

<u>DESCRIPTION</u>
<b>
<p>Using the <a href=https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/electronics/transistors-relays-and-controlling-high-current-loads/">great “Physical Computing” tutorials</a> at nyu.edu I was able to put together a MOSFET that allows the low voltage Arduino to control a higher voltage (6v) circuit.

<b>
<p>Next up, <a href="http://twitter.com/joshbressers/">Josh Bressers</a> suggested I try an H-Bridge circuit that will allow the Arduino to additionally dictate the direction the motors turn in.
