<u>NAME</u>
<b>Choose your own adventure: Lock-in!</b>

<u>DESCRIPTION</u>
<b><p>
Apple announced today it's latest product, a laptop with a 
capacitive-touch key surface in place of a physical keyboard; sans 
Escape key. Amusingly, many Vim users took to the Interwebs to 
sarcastically bemoan this loss of a default key binding.
</p></b>

<b><p>
In life, everything is a decision about how much lock-in you 
are willing to accept; what pros and cons matter most to you and 
how much control you are willing to give up in the face of that data.
