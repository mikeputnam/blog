<h5>Happy Birthday</h5>

<p>
You know what? I'm not good with fixit's or the latest things,<br/>
but I sure as heck am impressed, by Amy's most important things...<br/>
Learning to knit, it's not some little feat,<br/>
my wife sees the future, where grandkids smiles meet.
</p>

<p>
Decades wait for little one's their smiles unrepressed,<br/>
My family, this life's greatest fest, a jest, a test, the *best*...<br/>
</p>

<p>
Sons and daughters, life instilled,<br/>
fathers and mothers, hope fulfilled.<br/>
</p>

<p>
I love my life, I love my wife,<br/>
I love my kids, I love that I cannot come up with a rhyme,<br/>
But I know the first thing I will see tomorrow will be,<br/>
A hand-written card times three.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Dad I love you, and here is how I show you,</br>
Marker and crayon, you are my biggest fan.</br>
I know that before the regular day,</br>
You will hug me and send me on my way.</br>
</p>

<p>
This life is intense,</br>
The necessary immense,</br>
Parents, I can count on you to...</br>
Be there, be there, you're here,</br>
You're here, I hear.</br>
</p>
